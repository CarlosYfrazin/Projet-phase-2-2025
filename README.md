🚀 Project Objective

This project aims to support the creation of a new film studio by identifying the most profitable film genres and market trends using real-world data.

Through a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), we provide clear, data-driven recommendations to guide investment decisions in film production, ensuring maximum box office impact.

⸻

📁 Data Sources
	•	Box Office Mojo (domestic & international gross revenues)
	•	IMDb (genres, runtime, user ratings, studios)

The datasets were cleaned, merged, and enriched to build a comprehensive view of the film industry performance over the last decades.

⸻

🧠 Key Questions
	•	Which film genres generate the highest global revenues?
	•	Are multigenre films more profitable than single-genre ones?
	•	What can we learn from top-performing studios?

⸻

🔍 Main Insights
	1.	Top Genres: Sci-Fi, Adventure, and Animation dominate the global box office.
	2.	Multigenre Advantage: Films combining genres earn nearly double the revenue of monogenre ones.
	3.	Studio Models: Leading studios (e.g., BV, WB, HC) consistently produce high-grossing films by focusing on the right genres.

⸻

✅ Business Recommendations
	1.	🎯 Focus production on blockbuster genres (Sci-Fi, Adventure, Animation).
	2.	🔀 Develop multigenre films to broaden audience appeal and boost earnings.
	3.	🏢 Study and replicate strategies used by market-leading studios.
